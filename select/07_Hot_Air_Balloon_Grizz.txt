Hot Air Balloon
Life on the edge, I'm breaking the rules
Life on the edge'll break me in two
Four in the deuce with nothing to lose
Hot Air Balloon
Life on the edge, I'm breaking the rules
If I lose you, break me in two
Four in the deuce with nothing to lose

My world so crazy
Top model front page of the latest
All this shit on my mind lately (aye)
Pull up in that BM crazy
That, that money made me crazy (aye)
Pull up and skrt on your lady
Pouring up first on you hate me
Everything's hard when you famous
Getting calls from you lately (aye)
Get the guap and ball like KD
Yeah chan'll run it up on the daily
Ten back from the mall going crazy

Life on the edge, I'm breaking the rules
Life on the edge'll break me in two
Four in the deuce with nothing to lose
